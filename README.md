# Proposal for Final Project

For my final project, I’m want to build a Python tool called the Digital Privacy Risk Scanner. It will be a simple program that lets users check things like a password, a website, or an app name to see how at-risk they might be when it comes to digital privacy. The tool gives a score and some feedback based on how strong or weak their inputs are; for example, if their password is really common, or if a website isn’t secure (no HTTPS), or if an app typically asks for access to things like your location or microphone. For the apps, I’m focusing on the default permissions they request, while also letting users know they might have already turned those settings off; the point is to show how privacy risks often come built-in by design.

It won’t include a huge database of passwords, apps, or websites. It’s more of a proof of concept or prototype for a larger idea. The goal is to model how a tool like this could work in the future, especially as part of broader digital literacy or privacy education. It will run entirely on the user’s computer and won’t store or send anything, so it won’t compromise anyone’s privacy. 

I’m doing this because it connects really closely with my thesis, which looks at how communities experience digital vulnerability and how we might design tech that’s more transparent and empowering. This project lets me experiment with that in a super tangible way. On the technical side, I’ll be using functions, dictionaries, conditionals, loops, and basic input/output in Python. I want this tool to be something approachable and educational and something that helps people feel more in control of their digital lives.
